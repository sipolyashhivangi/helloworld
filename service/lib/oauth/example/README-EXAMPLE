This folder contains a very basic, bad coded and non structured example :)

The following actions should make the example run in good shape:

1. Create the tables as found in src/lib/tables.sql
2. Fill the tables with data as found in /src/example/data.sql
3. Create a consumer key and secret at example/provider/create_consumer.php and put the key and secret in the config
    file found at example/consumer/config.php
4. Change the endpoint URL's in example/consumer/config.php
5. Start the OAuth handshake by loading get_request_token.php in your browser. After the handshake, copy the
    received access token and secret to example/consumer/config.php
6. Now you can test the API call using example/consumer/api_call.php
